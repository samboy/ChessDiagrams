# Chess piece graphics

The chess piece graphics have been made by Colin M.L. Burnett.

While, as per *Eltra Corp. v. Ringer*, there is no need to follow the
license for the piece images in the United States (since the PNG images 
are raster renderings, *Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc.* 
does not apply), for jurisdictions which recognize the copyright of
fonts, and as a simple matter of courtesy towards Colin and his hard
work making these images, I am including a link to the licenses.

The graphics are available under multiple licenses here:

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chess_nll45.svg

I am using the BSD license for this distribution:
